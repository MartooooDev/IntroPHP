# IntroPHP

This is a repository I made to help me studying the PHP language from scratch.

Just a reminder that I'm not a teacher, I'm a student, so some things can be misunderstood by me or by whoever is reading this.
It's also important to note that I'm writing this just because it's the way I learn best (and i'm not actually hoping that someone will see this someday xD ).

With all of that said, if you're reading this, thank you, and I hope we can learn together :).

## First steps

To begin with PHP, on your VSCode, create a folder and call it "public". Inside it, create an archive and call it "index.php"

When you start a server, the file that the system will search to make the homepage of the website is that index file.

To start the PHP integrated server, you can use the command `php -S localhost:3000 -t public` on your VSCode terminal, so it will start a server on the port 3000, and will search for the index.php file inside that public folder you created previously.

Well, after starting your server and with the index file created, we can start by placing the basic php structure on the file. It looks like this:

```php
<?php
	#Your code goes here
?>
```

All the PHP code you want to be executed must be between the `<?php` and `?>` for it to be recognized as something to be executed.

For begginers, let's do the basic code ritual everyone knows you must do when starting a new language:

```php
<?php
	echo "Hello World!";
?>
```

After saving this file, go to your browser and insert the address you specified when starting the server. In my case, it was "localhost:3000", as defined by the command I told about earlier.

As you probably can see, `echo` is the function similar to python's print, where it only shows what you told it to show you on the screen, but in a browser website.

### Include and require

The include and require keywords are used to "import" other php archives into one php archive and execute them all in one, or cross-execute some files.

Usually, we put these on the top of the file, just to keep it organized. It needs the keyword followed by the path to that file inside your folders

```php
<?php
	include "./file2";
	//or
	require "./file2";
?>
```

The difference between them is that, as the name says, the `require` **must **be working for the file to load and execute without erros. If it doesn't, the main file won't execute as well.

Meanwhile, when using `include`, the file will try to execute anyway, even with errors within it.

There are variations to these keywords: the `include_once` and `require_once` . These make sure that the files are being executed only one time in the application they are included.

## Concepts

### Variables

Variables are a way to represent values using names that you can decide. This helps to keep track of what you're using, calculating, measuring, etc., using significant names.

A variable in PHP is defined using `$`, so, to define a variable to store a name, we should do:

```php
<?php
	$name	= 	"Martin";
	echo	$name;
?>
```

Now, as you can see, I already put the `echo` command to see if it is working correctly, and you can do it on your system just to make sure , but it is working here :).

Variables can be of some different types:

* Strings
  * Any text or number inside single or double quote marks.
    * "this is a string";
    * "123";
* Numbers
  * Numbers are divided into two groups: the Integers and the Floats (or doubles)
    * Integers refer to all numbers lower or greater then 0 that aren't fractions
      * 0
      * -2
      * 3
      * -100
      * 1000
    * Floats refer to integers+fractionary numbers
      * 1.2
      * 5.0
      * 12.4
      * 541.34412
      * 3.141593
* Booleans
  * Booleans refer to only two simple keywords:
    * True
    * False
* Arrays
  * Arrays are like a box, that contains some values inside. That means its a data type to store multiple values inside of it.
    * [1,2,3,4,5] (Array of integers)
    * ["Martin", "Marcus", "John", "Julia"] (Array of Strings)
* Objects
  * Objects are instances of classes on PHP. See Object Oriented Programing on PHP to undestand more.
    * ```php
      <?php
      class Person(){
      }
      echo gettype(new Person);
      ?>

      ```
* Null
  * It's the absence of value. That means it represents something that has none of the datatypes and no value whatsoever.

### Constants

Constants are, as they say, constants. They are a kind of "counterpart" to the variables, meaning that the value wont change.

To define a constand, we use the function `define(x, y)`, where x is the constant name and y is the value it'll receive. As stated, it cannot be changed.

If we try to define the same constant twice with different values, it'll return an error, saying that it is already defined.

```php
<?php
	define("NAME", "Marto");
?>
```

PHP has some pre-defined constants on it's core, for example:

* \_\_FUNCTION_\_: when inside a funcion, returns the function name;
* \_\_METHOD\_\_:  when inside a function or method, returns the function or method name;
* DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR: substitutes the "/";

If we want to know if a constant is already defined or not, we can use a conditional structure:

```php
<?php
	define("NAME", "MARTIN");

	if(defined(NAME)){
		echo "this constant is already defined";
	}

?>
```

This will print the message if the constant is already defined.

If you don't know yet about conditionals, we'll see that later in this page.

Another thing you can do is return all the constants the php has defined:

```php
<?php
	$cons=get_defined_constants(true);
	var_dump($cons);

?>
```

This will return a big message on the page, that seems like an error, but it's not. It shows every constant defined by php system that you can use.

### Instructions

Instructions are every line of code finished with `;` .

The last line of a php file does not need `;` to end the last instruction, because the closing tag of php (`?>`) counts as the end of an instruction as well.

### Aritimetic Operators

The Aritimetic Operators refer to any operator used for, of course, aritmetic operations. These include Sum, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.

#### Sum

The aritimetic operator for sum is `+`. It adds the values that are placed around it.

```php
<?php
	$number1= 10;
	$number2= 20;

	$sum= $number1 + $number2;
?>
```

The `$sum` variable will get the sum of the variables `$number1` and `$number2`, in this case, `10+20 = 30`.


#### Subtraction

The aritimetic operator for subtraction is `-`. It subtracts the value on the right from the value on the left of it.

```php
<?php
	$number1= 10;
	$number2= 20;

	$sub= $number2 - $number1;
?>
```

The `$sub` variable will get the subtraction of the variable `$number1` from `$number2`, in this case, `20-10 = 10`.


#### Multiplication

The aritimetic operator for multiplication is `*`. It multiplies the values placed around it.

```php
<?php
	$number1= 10;
	$number2= 20;

	$mult= $number1 * number2;
?>
```

The `$mult` variable will get the multiplication of the variables `$number1` and `$number2`, in this case, `10*20 = 200`.


#### Division

The aritimetic operator for division is `/`. It divides the value on the left for the value on the right.

```php
<?php
	$number1= 10;
	$number2= 20;

	$div= $number2 / $number1;
?>
```

The `$div` variable will get the division of the variable `$number2` for `$number1`, in this case, `20/10 = 2 `.


#### Modulus

The aritimetic operator for modulus is `%`. It returns the rest of the division between the first and the second number.

```php
<?php
	$number1= 10;
	$number2= 20;

	$mod= 20 % 10;
?>
```

The `$mod` variable will get the modulus between `$number1` and `$number2`, in this case, 0, because it's an exact division.

#### Operator precedence

When calculating a bigger expression, there is an [order of what operations it&#39;ll calculate first](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.precedence.php#:~:text=The%20precedence%20of%20an%20operator,to%20force%20precedence%2C%20if%20necessary. "Open PHP documentation"). In PHP is no different. The way expressions are calculated are:

1. Parenthesis
2. Brackets
3. Curly brackets
4. Multiplication/Division
5. Sum/Subtraction

When they are in the same "precedence level", the file just calculate from left to right of the expression.

### Comparation operators

Comparation operators compare two values and return a boolean result (True or False).


| Operator | Name                    | Description                                                                |
| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <        | less than               | verifies if the first number is less than the second number                |
| >        | greater than            | verifies if the first number is greater than the second number             |
| <=       | less or equal to        | verifies if the first number is less than or equal to the second number    |
| >=       | greater or equal to     | verifies if the first number is greater than or equal to the second number |
| !=       | different value         | verifies if the first and second values are different                      |
| !==      | different value or type | verifies if the first and second values or types are different             |
| ==       | equal value             | verifies if the first and second values are equal                          |
| ===      | equal value and type    | verifies if the first and second values andÂ types are equal               |


### Logical Operators

Logical operators compares booleans to get to a bollean result (Tabela verdade foda* ver dps)

| Operator | Name | Description                                                                                 |
| -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &&       | and  | If both the booleans are true, returns true. If one or none of them is false, returns false |
| \|\|     | or   | If one of the values is true, returns true. Only returns false if both are false.           |

*The 'and' and 'or' are also possible to be used, but, for precedence reasons, it's better to always use '&&' and '||'

### If and else

During development, you'll be faced with situations where you only want a code to be executed if something happens.

For thos situations, PHP got the `if` statement. This will check if something is true, and execute only if it is.

When using the statement, you can use logic, aritmetic and comparation operators, because they return boolean values, used by the if statement.

```php
<?php
	$number1= 30;
	$number2= 50;
	if(number1 > number2){
		echo "number1 is greater than number2";
	}
?>
```

```php
<?php
	$n1=30;
	$n2=50;
	$isAdmin= True;

	if(number1 > number2 && isAdmin){
		echo "Thats true";
	}

?>
```


Although this sintax does something when the argument is `True`, it does nothing if it is `False`. That's why we use the `else `statement. It will execute if the argument isn't true for any ifs declared before it.

```php
<?php
	if(something){
		#do something
	} else {
		#do another thing
	}
?>
```



There is also a special syntax that can be used, only being one line of code: 

```php
<?php
 echo ($statement)	?	"option if true"	:	"option if false";
	#Variable/ statement
	#its like saying if(statement){echo "option if true";} else {echo "option if false";}
?>
```

### Switch

Switch is another type of conditional  statement, like the if/else one. 

However, this one verifies the value instead of conditions to do certain actions.

```php
<?php

$name= "Martin";
switch ($name){
	case "Martin":
		echo "The name is Martin";
		break;
	case "Julia":
		echo "The name is Julia";
		break
	case "Lucas":
		echo "The name is Lucas";
		break
	case default:
		echo "Name unknown";
		break;
}

?>
```

### Extra: PHP Cheatsheet

| Command   | Example                 | Description                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| echo      | echo "Hello World";     | Prints the message between quotes on the page.                      |
| gettype() | gettype("Hello World"); | Function to return the datatype of the argument between parentesis. |

### Extra 2: PHP with HTML on the same file

Within a PHP file, it is possible to include your HTML code aswell. It is simple as putting one structure after another:

```php
<?php
	$name= "Martin";
?>

<html>
	<head>
	</head>

	<body>
		<h2>Welcome <?php echo $nome ?> </h2>
	</body>
</html>
```

This allows the utilization of the PHP funcionalities directly with HTML. Even though this seems useful, it is not used too often anymore.

### Extra 3: Truth table for logical operators

This is the truth table of comparation for logical operators and results with them

| Boolean1 | L.O. | Boolean2 | Result |
| :------: | :--: | :------: | :----: |
|   True   |  II  |   True   |  True  |
|   True   | \|\| |  False  |  True  |
|  False  | \|\| |   True   |  True  |
|  False  | \|\| |  False  | False |
|   True   |  &&  |   True   |  True  |
|   True   |  &&  |  False  | False |
|  False  |  &&  |   True   | False |
|  False  |  &&  |  False  | False |


### No Place yet

- Concatenation:

  - We use "." for concatenating text
    - ```php
      <?php
      	$name= "Martin";
      	$fullName= $name."Romao";
      	echo $fullName;  //Will print "Martin Romao"
      ?>
      ```
- Atribuition Operators

  - In order to facilitate some aritmetic operations and atribuitions;
    - `$num1 `+= `$num2 `-> adds `$num2 `to `$num1 `and set the result to the variable `$num1`


- Increment and decrement operators

  - Adds or subtracts 1 from the variable
  - Before or after the calling of the variable
  - ```php
    $number= 10;
    echo ++$number; //Prints 11 and set the variable to this value.
    echo $number++; //Prints 10, then turns it to 11, for when using it later.

    echo --$number;
    echo $number--; //does the same thing as before, but subtracts one instead of adding
    ```
- Comparation operators
